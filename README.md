Multiplication using lists:

The program takes two lists as input its “Infinite numbers”.. The two lists have nodes for each digit in the two numbers to be multiplied for “Infinite numbers”. The multiply function implements the pen and paper method of multiplying two numbers. For this, we reverse the two lists and start multiplying numbers from the unit's place. The unit’s place of the result of multiplying two numbers is stored in a new node that forms the result list. A ‘carry’ variable caries the carryout in each step of the process. The method returns the result list reversed. On reversing this list we arrive at the answer.
